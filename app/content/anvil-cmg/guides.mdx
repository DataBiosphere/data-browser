# About the AnVIL Data Explorer

The AnVIL Data Explorer enables faceted searches of open and managed access datasets hosted in AnVIL, making them easier to find and analyze. You’ll now be able to streamline your data-gathering process with custom cohorts to keep your workspaces efficient and organized. You’ll be able to choose exactly the data you want to work with

Sort the datasets you’re browsing in the [AnVIL Data Explorer]({browserURL}/datasets) based on the following managed access categories:

- Datasets
- Donors
- BioSamples
- Activities
- Files

The AnVIL program is actively receiving and ingesting additional datasets. The AnVIL Data Explorer will be updated periodically as new datasets are released.

## How to find and use data with the AnVIL Data Explorer

Documentation for using the AnVIL Data Explorer can be found in a series of articles in [Terra Support’s AnVIL documentation](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/sections/25968420865691-AnVIL-Researchers).

## Limitations of the Data Explorer

At the time of this writing, known limitations of the AnVIL Data Explorer are

- Some dataset descriptions are incomplete or missing. These are in the process of being populated.
- The complete metadata for a dataset is exported when the complete dataset is selected, but custom cohort building using finer-grained facets (e.g., subject, sample, or file) may result in incomplete metadata export.
