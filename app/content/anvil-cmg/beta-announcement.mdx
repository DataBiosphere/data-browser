# Beta Announcement

AnVIL is pleased to announce the public beta release of the AnVIL Data Explorer for Terra on Google Cloud Platform. The AnVIL Data Explorer is accessible at [https://explore.anvilproject.org](https://explore.anvilproject.org).

We are actively looking for your feedback! Please provide feedback via [https://help.anvilproject.org](https://help.anvilproject.org). Please select the category “AnVIL Data Explorer” and create an existing or update an existing topic there.

The AnVIL Data Explorer enables faceted searches of open and managed access datasets hosted in AnVIL, making it easier for researchers to find and custom-build cohorts. Documentation for using the AnVIL Data Explorer can be found [here](/guides).

The AnVIL team is actively indexing more datasets, so the available datasets should grow every few weeks.

At the time of this writing, known limitations of the AnVIL Data Explorer are:

- Currently supports Terra on Google Cloud Platform. Support for Terra on Microsoft Azure is coming later this year.
- Incomplete dataset descriptions and other supporting information. This information is limited and should be growing, which will increase the usefulness of the AnVIL Data Explorer.
- Limited support for metadata export. This will evolve over time, but currently, some metadata is not handed off to Terra on GCP. We expect this to improve after the release.

Currently, the General Availability release is targeted for around the middle of 2024. The timing will depend on the feedback and the nature of any issues discovered during this beta period.
