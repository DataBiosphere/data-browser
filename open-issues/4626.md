# Instructions

Similar to Issue #4594 when updating the catalog default increment, use these steps:

1. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Update the CATALOG constant in the following files to reflect the new catalog version:
      - `site-config/hca-dcp/dev/config.ts`
      - `site-config/hca-dcp/ma-prod/config.ts`
2. **Changes Made**:
   - Change the CATALOG constant from `dcp55` to `dcp56` in both files.

Ensure these changes are committed following this same logic. Accidentally close the task inadvertently or make processing considerations.
