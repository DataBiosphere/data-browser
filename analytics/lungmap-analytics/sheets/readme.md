## Generating Reports
- Update `constants.py` to reflect the date ranges and file name you would like for the report
- Open `./generate_sheets_report.ipynb` using your favorite IDE or by running `jupyter notebook` and selecting it from the browser window that appears
- Run all cells in the Jupyter notebook by pressing the button with two arrows at the top. You will be prompted to log in to your Google Account, which must have access to the relevant analytics property
- Check your Google Drive to ensure that the desired spreadsheet is present
