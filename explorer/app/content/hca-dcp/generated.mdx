### DCP Generated Matrices

DCP Generated Matrices are those produced with [uniform pipelines](https://data.humancellatlas.org/pipelines).
All DCP Generated Matrices include [quality control metrics](https://data.humancellatlas.org/pipelines/qc-metrics).

The 10x matrices include raw counts. Smart-seq2 matrices include TPMs and
estimated counts. Matrices are in Loom file format.

### Linking DCP-Generated Matrices to Project Metadata

To link the DCP project matrix to the project metadata TSV, match the matrix input_id column with the metadata TSV sequencing_process.provenance.document_id column.
