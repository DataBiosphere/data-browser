The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium aims to modernize the human reference to include a collection of diverse and highly accurate, haplotype-phased genome assemblies. This initiative will generate new technical standards in genome sequencing, scalable and reproducible assembly methods, and pangenomic tool development to ensure comprehensive variant discovery.
